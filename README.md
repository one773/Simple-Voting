# Simple-Voting
Simple Voting System through Smart Contract and Blockchain Technology.

**Pretty self explanatory to be honest. This is a small project to practice my solidity learning.**

Main idea is:
1. Register candidates.
2. A voting system to collect unique votes (1 per address)
3. Winner Calculation (highest votes of a single address) in case of a tie, return candidates with highest votes.
